Why FAQ Pages Are A Priority


FAQ pages continue to be a priority area for SEO and digital marketing professionals.

An FAQ page is one of the simplest ways to improve your site and help site visitors and users.

Your FAQ section should be seen as a constantly expanding source of value provided to your audience. It is a place where their ever-changing and growing requirements are not only met but anticipated and exceeded frequently.

In no small part, the importance of FAQ pages has been driven in recent years by the growth in voice search, mobile search, and personal/home assistants and speakers.

These predominantly rely on the pre-results (Google Answers and Featured Snippets) and can be explicitly targeted with FAQ pages.
